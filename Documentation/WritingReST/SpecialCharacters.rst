==================
Special Characters
==================

Q: What characters can I use? 

A: You may enter any Unicode character directly. There is no other way to
specify characters. The `default encoding <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html#source-encoding>`__
of a file is utf-8.

Keep in mind that while you CAN use any Unicode character not all of them will be displayed.
In general fonts contain glyphs for common characters only.

Some lists of characters:
