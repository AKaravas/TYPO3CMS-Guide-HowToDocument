About Licenses
==============

((to be written))

- Old manuals that are maintained by the TYPO3 documentation team usually
  have the http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/ license. We keep that until
  something else may be decided somewhen in the future.
  
- New manuals should use a Creative Commons license.
