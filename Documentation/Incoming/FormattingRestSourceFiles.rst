Formatting reST Source Files
============================

((to be written))

For your own texts you can use any style you want to.

For "official" manuals this holds::

   - use utf-8

   - the only way to include "special" characters is to use them directly

   - don't use tabs

   - one indentenation level consists of three spaces

   - code examples use three spaces as indentation level as well

   - if possible, keep lines shorter than 80 characters. So lines should have
     0..79 characters, followed by newline characters.

   - if lines need to be longer for some reason use multiples of three:
        0 to 79       = recommended
        0 to 91
        0 to 121

     these can be set in sublime for example.
     add screen shots (Jetbrains, Sublime, ...)
